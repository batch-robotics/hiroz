//! `RMW_EVENT_MESSAGE_LOST` must actually be raised by a live subscriber.
//!
//! `event.rs`'s unit tests pin `MessageLossTracker`'s arithmetic. They say
//! nothing about whether anything *calls* it: delete the `observe_loss(..)` line
//! from the subscriber's receive path and every one of them still passes. This
//! file is the detector for that wiring.
//!
//! Loss is induced deterministically rather than by trying to drop a packet.
//! The subscriber's own key expression is published to directly, through the
//! node's zenoh session, with a hand-built [`Attachment`] carrying a chosen
//! sequence number — so the gap is exact and there is no timing to lose.
