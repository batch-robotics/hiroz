# Release version semantics: a tag is THREE different strings, and every
# release channel has to use the right one at each site.
#
#   release identity   what the tag/release/download path is called   0.2.0-rc1
#   asset core         what the FILENAMES carry                       0.2.0
#   binary version     what `hu --version` prints                     hu 0.2.0
#
# They coincide for a normal release and diverge for a pre-release, because
# `build-hu-release.nu` names every asset for the crate version: an rc ships the
# same crate as the release it rehearses. That divergence is why a pre-release
# is the only tag shape that can catch this class of defect — and, since
# `push: tags: v*` is the GitHub release workflow's only trigger, an rc tag is
# also its only rehearsal vehicle.
#
# This test needs no runner, no network and no build. It runs in seconds and is
# the check that would have caught F13 on either channel.

#    and no build.
#
#    D1 — docs/tools/hu-install.md's first instruction is
#         `curl -fsSL <base>/install-hu.sh | sh`, and install-hu.sh was never
#         published. build-hu-release.nu writes six assets; the installer is
#         not one of them, and the release job uploaded `dist/**`.
#
#    D7 — the post-publish check stopped at `hu plugin list | grep meter`.
#         Plugin discovery reads FILENAMES ONLY and never opens the component,
#         so an empty file named hu_meter.wasm passed every assertion this
#         channel made.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
