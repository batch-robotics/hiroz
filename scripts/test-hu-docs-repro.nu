# Reproduce every documented `hu` command against a *downloaded* install.
#
# The bar this enforces: a user who downloads `hu` and its plugins — no repo,
# no cargo, no build tree — can run every `hu` command that appears in the
# docs. A command in the docs is a promise; this executes the promises.
#
# Commands are classified by a `repro:` directive. Two forms, because docs are
# for readers first and the directives must not clutter the rendered page:
#
#   1. Fence-level, as an HTML comment immediately before the fence. Invisible
#      in the rendered docs, and covers every command in that fence — which is
#      what most fences need, since they tend to be homogeneous:
#
#          <!-- repro: skip needs a real rclcpp node exposing get_logger_levels -->
#          ```bash
#          hu monitor log-level /talker
#          ```
#
#   2. Per-command, as a `# repro:` line inside the fence, overriding the
#      fence default for the single command that follows. This one IS visible,
#      so use it only where the note earns its place.
#
# An unannotated command defaults to `run` and MUST succeed. Nothing is silently
# ignored: a docs command missing from the report fails the suite.
#
# Two classes are extracted. `hu ...`, the promises about the tool, and INSTALL
# commands (`curl`, `install-hu.sh`, `tar`, `sha256sum`, `cp`), the promises
# about getting it. The second is easy to forget, and was missed once -- a suite
# that cannot see a command cannot report it missing.

# This separation is the point. `hu` cannot generate its own traffic: `hu meter
# pub` needs a message schema from a `.msg` on HIROZ_MSG_PATH or from a live
# node, and a release ships neither. So a suite whose only fixture is `hu
# router` measures an empty graph, and every `hu meter` command it runs is
# reduced to checking that the process started. That is how a truncated plugin
# could pass a release check.
#
# The publisher therefore comes from the build tree — it stands in for the
# "existing ROS 2 or hiroz deployment" that `hu` is documented to observe.
