# hu Toolkit — Overview

`hu` — short for **H**iroz **U**nion, and the crate that builds it is [`hiroz-union`](https://github.com/ZettaScaleLabs/hiroz/tree/main/crates/hiroz-union) — is the tooling ecosystem for the hiroz stack: a single, daemon-free binary that talks directly to Zenoh and grows through WebAssembly plugins. It replaces `ros2 topic`, `ros2 node`, `ros2 service`, `ros2 action`, `ros2 param`, and much of `rqt` — but the more important idea is that most of what `hu` does, including the observation and measurement commands that ship in the box, is delivered as **plugins**. This page introduces that ecosystem; the rest of this section drills into each part.

## The ecosystem at a glance

`hu` is a platform, not a monolith. A thin dispatcher routes `hu <name> <args>` to one of three things, all layered over a shared **core engine**:

- **Frontends** — native runtimes that present the platform and own their I/O: `tui` (interactive terminal — also what bare `hu` runs), `web` (HTTP server), `stream` (newline-delimited JSON events), and the one-shot **CLI**. A frontend owns the core engine and *hosts the plugins that target it*.
- **Plugins** — sandboxed WebAssembly components that do the ROS 2 work. Each targets one frontend through a WIT world: a CLI command (`meter`, `monitor`, or your own), a TUI pane, or a web handler. `meter` and `monitor` are the reference plugins this repo ships the source for — but they are ordinary `.wasm` files loaded from the plugin directory at startup, exactly like a third-party plugin. There is no compiled-in plugin: same contract, same loading path for everyone.
- **Management** — native commands for platform infrastructure that touch no graph: `router` (run an embedded Zenoh router) and `plugin` (list/validate installed plugins).

The relationship that ties it together: a **frontend is the native host side** of an interaction surface, and a **plugin is the sandboxed guest side** of that same surface. That is why the WIT worlds line up one-to-one with the frontends:

| Frontend (native) | Guest contract (WIT world) | A plugin here is… | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cli` | `hu-cli-plugin` | a `hu <name>` command (`meter`, `monitor`, yours) | ✅ shipped |
| `web` | `hu-web-plugin` | an HTTP route handler | 🟡 landing soon (host wired, no reference plugin) |
| `tui` | `hu-tui-plugin` | a pane in the TUI | 🟡 landing soon (host fully wired; no reference plugin yet) |
| `stream` | *(none)* | — (a raw dump of the core event bus) | ✅ shipped |

    accDescr: The hu dispatcher routes to native management commands (router, plugin) or to native frontends (cli, tui, web, stream). Frontends host sandboxed WASM plugins that target their WIT world. Frontends and plugins share one core engine, which reaches the ROS 2 graph through a Zenoh router.

```

The moving parts:

- **Dispatcher** — `hu` parses the first argument and routes it to a frontend, a plugin (via the CLI frontend), or a management command. It owns no ROS logic itself.
- **Core engine** — one shared `CoreEngine`: the Zenoh session, the live graph built from the liveliness index, the event bus. Every frontend and plugin sits on it; there is no `_ros2_daemon` and no DDS discovery.
- **Frontends** — native, trusted runtimes. `tui` owns the terminal and renders tui-plugins as panes; `web` serves web-plugins as routes; `cli` runs one cli-plugin and exits; `stream` dumps core events as JSON. They are native (not plugins) because they need full host access — the terminal, the runtime, the sessions — which the sandbox withholds.
- **Plugins** — `meter` (measurement: `hz`, `bw`, `delay`, `echo`, `pub`, `list`, `info`, service/action/param) and `monitor` (observation: `watch`, `graph`, `log`, `log-level`) are the reference plugins whose source ships in this repo; they are built to `.wasm` and installed into the plugin path. Any `.wasm` in `$HU_PLUGIN_PATH` or `~/.local/share/hu/plugins/` becomes a `hu <name>` command with no registration step, no Python entry-points, and no shared runtime state — `meter`/`monitor` are discovered the same way.
- **Management** — `router` starts an embedded Zenoh router (see [Running a router](hu.md#running-a-router)); `plugin` lists and validates installed plugins. Native infrastructure, no graph involvement.
- **Sandbox** — WASM plugins are capability-gated: a plugin only gets the host access (topic subscribe/publish, service calls, raw-CDR access, metrics) it is explicitly granted. Frontends and management are the deliberate native exceptions.

## The problem with existing CLI tools

ROS 2 ships two standard toolsets: `ros2cli` for the terminal and `rqt` for the GUI. Both are implemented in Python and built on top of RCL (the ROS Client Library). This means they carry the full cost of the Python ROS 2 stack — a background daemon, DDS discovery, Python message deserialization — even for the simplest operations.

| Pain point | ros2cli behavior | Effect on user |
|---|---|---|
| **Fragile daemon** | Spawns `_ros2_daemon` on first use; snapshots `ROS_DOMAIN_ID`/`RMW_IMPLEMENTATION` at startup ([ros2cli#1238](https://github.com/ros2/ros2cli/issues/1238), [#502](https://github.com/ros2/ros2cli/issues/502), [#934](https://github.com/ros2/ros2cli/issues/934)) | New terminal with different domain ID silently queries the wrong domain; daemon crashes on enterprise networks; WSL2/container health check fails; fix is always `pkill -f _ros2_daemon` |
| **Inaccurate rate measurement** | `ros2 topic hz` deserializes every message in Python inside the GIL ([ros2cli#871](https://github.com/ros2/ros2cli/issues/871), [#1043](https://github.com/ros2/ros2cli/issues/1043)) | Saturates near ~1,400 Hz on a ~97 kHz burst publisher (≥65× under-read); camera topics at 30 fps report 15–22 fps |
| **No machine-readable output** | All `ros2` commands emit human-formatted text with no stable format | Parsing requires string-splitting on `/` and column counting; breaks across ROS 2 versions |
| **Requires a full ROS 2 install** | Depends on RCL, Python stack, and sourced `setup.bash` | CI pipelines and developer laptops without a distro must carry a full Docker image |

## What hu does differently

`hu` connects directly to the Zenoh router that underlies the hiroz stack. It does not use RCL, does not start a daemon, and does not deserialize messages in Python.

| What hu does | How |
|---|---|
| No daemon, always fresh | Every invocation opens a Zenoh session, reads the live liveliness index, and exits — always a real-time snapshot |
| Byte-level measurement | `hu meter hz` / `hu meter bw` timestamp arrivals at the raw Zenoh byte layer; a 100 MB point cloud costs the same to count as a 10-byte string |
| JSON output on most commands | Most subcommands emit newline-delimited JSON with `--json`; composable with `jq`, shell scripts, and CI harnesses without fragile text parsing. Some commands ignore the flag; of those, `hu monitor watch`/`log-level` and `hu meter echo`/`delay` are not NDJSON, while `hu monitor log` and `hu meter param set` print bare JSON anyway |
| Plugin extensibility | Drop a `.wasm` file into `$HU_PLUGIN_PATH` or `~/.local/share/hu/plugins/` and it becomes a `hu <name>` subcommand; no Python entry-points, no `setup.cfg`, no shared runtime state; plugins are sandboxed and capability-gated |

**JSON output on most commands** makes it composable with `jq`, shell scripts, CI harnesses, and log pipelines without fragile text parsing. `--json` is a global flag, so it is *accepted* everywhere, but some commands ignore it. Of those, `hu monitor log` and `hu meter param set` still print bare JSON, while `hu monitor watch`/`log-level` and `hu meter echo`/`delay` do not — so check a command's output before depending on it:

<!-- repro: skip needs a live graph and writes to /var/log -->
```bash
# Check camera rate in CI
rate=$(hu meter hz /camera/image_raw --duration 5 --json | jq '.rate_hz')
[ "$(echo "$rate > 28.0" | bc)" = "1" ] || exit 1

# Stream graph events to a log file as newline-delimited JSON
# (hu stream, not hu monitor watch — the latter ignores --json)
hu stream --json >> /var/log/ros-graph-events.jsonl
```

---

## What hu does not do

`hu` only works with the hiroz stack and `rmw_zenoh_cpp`. It cannot see nodes that use `rmw_fastrtps_cpp` or `rmw_cyclonedds_cpp`. If your system has a mix of RMW implementations, `ros2 topic hz` will see topics that `hu meter hz` cannot.

There is no `hu launch`, no `hu pkg`, and no `hu run`. `hu` is scoped to graph introspection, measurement, and bridging — the operations that the Python-based tools do poorly at scale.

---

## When to switch

| Condition | Use `hu` | Use `ros2cli` |
|---|---|---|
| RMW implementation | `rmw_zenoh_cpp` or pure hiroz | `rmw_fastrtps_cpp` or `rmw_cyclonedds_cpp` |
| Rate measurement above 500 Hz | yes | no — Python GIL saturates |
| CLI tools in CI / automation | yes — `--json` on most commands | fragile text parsing |
| No ROS 2 install available | yes — single binary | no — requires distro + `setup.bash` |
| Live graph events without polling | yes — `hu monitor watch` | no — must poll `ros2 node list` |
| `ros2 launch` / `ros2 pkg` / `ros2 run` | not planned | yes |
| Nodes on non-Zenoh RMW | no — invisible to `hu` | yes |
