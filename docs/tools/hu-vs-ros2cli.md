# hu vs. ros2cli and rqt

`hu` is the command-line toolset for the hiroz stack. This page compares it to `ros2cli` (the standard ROS 2 command-line tools) and `rqt` (the Qt-based GUI tools), covering both what `hu` replaces and what it adds.

| Extensible via plugins | no | yes (rqt plugins) | yes (`.wasm` plugins) |
| Live multi-topic rate dashboard | — | rqt_topic | `hu` (interactive TUI) |

**`hu meter pub` resolves the message schema from `.msg` files on disk**, so — like `ros2 topic pub` — it can publish to an empty topic with no node present. The plugin host reads the type from a `.msg` under `HIROZ_MSG_PATH` (colon-separated package or prefix directories, e.g. an ament `.../share`); if the type isn't on disk it falls back to discovering it from a live publisher or subscriber on the topic. Only when neither is available does it report a clear "could not resolve a message schema" error rather than guessing.

The subscribing side (`hu meter echo`, `hu meter delay`) consults the same two sources in the **opposite** order: live discovery first, `HIROZ_MSG_PATH` only as a fallback. The orders differ because `pub` is told its type by the caller — disk alone is sufficient, and a live node need not exist at all — whereas `subscribe` is given only a topic, so it must consult the graph regardless, both to learn which `.msg` to load and to reproduce the publisher's exact type hash in its key expression.

## Measurement accuracy: `hu meter hz` vs. `ros2 topic hz`

`ros2 topic hz` deserializes every message in Python before counting it. This is a known bottleneck: see ros2cli [#871](https://github.com/ros2/ros2cli/issues/871), [#1043](https://github.com/ros2/ros2cli/issues/1043), [#843](https://github.com/ros2/ros2cli/issues/843).

`hu meter hz` subscribes at the raw Zenoh byte layer. It records arrival timestamps from the transport without deserializing any payload.

**At moderate rates (≤ 500 Hz, any payload size)** both tools report the same rate to within measurement noise — the Python overhead is not the limiting factor and the differential is under a few percent.

**At high rates the Python GIL becomes the bottleneck.** We measured this with a `yield_now` publisher that saturates the CPU to produce a burst stream, with each tool pinned to a separate CPU to isolate the measurement.

```mermaid
xychart-beta
    title "Rate measurement: ~97 kHz burst publisher"
    x-axis ["Ground truth", "hu meter hz", "ros2 topic hz"]
    y-axis "Measured rate (Hz)" 0 --> 100000
    bar [96829, 90971, 1398]
```

*`hu` numbers measured from internal testing on a release binary. `ros2 topic hz` figure from a prior run on identical hardware; ros2 was not available in the benchmark shell. These are internal measurements, not a reproducible public benchmark — treat the specific numbers as illustrative of the order-of-magnitude gap rather than exact figures for your hardware.*

| Metric | Measured value |
|---|---|
| Ground truth (time-avg) | 96,829 Hz |
| `hu meter hz` (sliding window) | 90,971 Hz |
| `ros2 topic hz` | ~1,400 Hz |
| hu advantage | **≥ 65×** |

`ros2 topic hz` saturates below 1–2 kHz because `rclpy` deserializes every message inside the Python GIL. `hu meter hz` tracks the arrival stream an order of magnitude closer to the true rate. At the rates common in robot perception pipelines (image at 30 fps, lidar at 10–20 Hz, IMU at 100–400 Hz) both tools agree closely; the gap opens above ~500 Hz. `hu meter bw` has the same property: it counts bytes at the Zenoh subscription layer without deserializing.

## No daemon

See [Why hu?](why-hu.md#the-problem-with-existing-cli-tools) for the full explanation of why `ros2cli`'s daemon model causes problems and how `hu`'s daemon-free design avoids them. The table below lists the specific failure modes this replaces, for reference when comparing against `ros2cli`.

| Failure mode | Trigger | Symptom | Recovery |
|---|---|---|---|
| Stale domain ID ([#1238](https://github.com/ros2/ros2cli/issues/1238)) | Change `ROS_DOMAIN_ID` or `RMW_IMPLEMENTATION` in a new terminal | Daemon silently queries the wrong domain | `pkill -f _ros2_daemon` |
| Silent daemon death ([#502](https://github.com/ros2/ros2cli/issues/502), [#702](https://github.com/ros2/ros2cli/issues/702)) | Strict firewall rules or long idle period | All `ros2` commands return empty results | `pkill -f _ros2_daemon` then re-run |
| Container / WSL2 incompatibility ([#934](https://github.com/ros2/ros2cli/issues/934)) | Daemon health check fails in certain runtimes | `ros2 topic list` returns nothing | None — re-enter with a clean environment |

## DDS Discovery Server incompatibility

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph DDS["DDS CLI path"]
        A["ros2 topic list"] --> B["DDS participant discovery"]
        B --> C["Fast-DDS Discovery Server"]
        C --> D["❌ Incompatible topology<br>(returns empty / hangs)<br>rmw_fastrtps#499"]
    end
    subgraph ZenohPath["hu path"]
        E["hu meter list topics"] --> F["Zenoh liveliness index<br>(read from router)"]
        F --> G["✅ Full graph<br>regardless of router mode"]
    end
```

When using the Fast-DDS Discovery Server (`FASTRTPS_DEFAULT_PROFILES_FILE` with a `<discovery_server>` profile), `ros2 topic list`, `ros2 node info`, and `ros2 topic echo` all fail silently because `ros2cli` uses standard DDS participant discovery, which is incompatible with the topology the Discovery Server imposes ([rmw_fastrtps#499](https://github.com/ros2/rmw_fastrtps/issues/499)).

`hu` reads the Zenoh liveliness index directly from the router — no DDS layer, no Discovery Server concept. This advantage is scoped: if your network uses `rmw_fastrtps_cpp` or `rmw_cyclonedds_cpp`, `hu` cannot see those nodes at all (see [When ros2cli is the right choice](#when-ros2cli-is-the-right-choice)).

---

## Machine-readable output

Most `hu` commands emit newline-delimited JSON with `--json`. This makes them composable with `jq`, shell scripts, CI test harnesses, and logging pipelines without fragile text parsing.

!!! warning "`--json` is accepted everywhere but honoured selectively"
    `--json` is a global flag, so the argument parser accepts it on *every* command — including ones where it has no effect. Those are `hu monitor watch`, `log` and `log-level` (only `graph` honours it), `hu meter echo`, `delay`, `param set`, `service find` and `service type`. Ignoring the flag does not always mean the output is unparseable: `hu monitor log` and `hu meter param set` already print one bare JSON object per line, because the plugin host hands plugins their messages and service responses pre-serialised as JSON. The rest are not JSON — `hu monitor watch` and `hu meter delay` print prose, `hu monitor log-level` prefixes its JSON with `log levels:`, `hu meter echo` prefixes each message with its topic (`[/chatter] {"data":"hello"}`), and `service find`/`service type` print bare unquoted values. Treat this as a non-exhaustive list and check a command's output before depending on it in a pipeline. For a machine-readable stream of graph change events, use [`hu stream --json`](hu.md#stream-mode) instead of `hu monitor watch --json`.

`ros2cli` outputs human-formatted text with no stable machine-readable format. Parsing `ros2 topic list` output requires string splitting on `/` and filtering out blank lines; parsing `ros2 topic info` requires column-counting. Both break across ROS 2 versions.

<!-- repro: skip needs sensor_msgs publishers and writes to /var/log -->
```bash
# Filter to sensor_msgs topics only
hu meter list topics --json | jq '.[] | select(.type | contains("sensor_msgs"))'

# Extract all publisher node names for /scan
hu meter info topic /scan --json | jq '.publishers[].node'

# Check that hz is within bounds in a CI script
rate=$(hu meter hz /camera/image_raw --duration 5 --json | jq '.rate_hz')
[ "$(echo "$rate > 25" | bc)" = "1" ] || exit 1

# Stream graph events to a log file as newline-delimited JSON
# (hu stream, not hu monitor watch — the latter ignores --json)
hu stream --json >> /var/log/ros-graph-events.jsonl
```

---

## Live graph events: `hu monitor watch`

`ros2cli` has no command that streams graph change events. To detect when a node appears or disappears you must poll `ros2 node list` in a loop, introducing latency proportional to your polling interval and burning CPU during quiet periods.

`hu monitor watch` subscribes to Zenoh liveliness tokens, which are the mechanism hiroz and `rmw_zenoh_cpp` use to announce entity existence. It prints a line the moment a node, topic, service, or action appears or disappears — with sub-millisecond latency after the transport propagates the change.

<!-- repro: timeout-quiet 5 -->
```bash
hu monitor watch
```

```text
node appeared:    /camera_driver
topic appeared:   /camera/image_raw
node removed:     /camera_driver
```

Use cases that are impossible or expensive with ros2cli polling:

- **Launch sequencing**: wait for a specific node to appear before starting a dependent node, without a timed sleep.
- **Integration test teardown**: assert that all nodes disappear within N ms of sending a shutdown signal.
- **Supervision**: trigger a restart when a critical node disappears unexpectedly.
- **Debugging intermittent crashes**: record all graph events with timestamps to reconstruct the sequence of node deaths.

`rqt_graph` shows a static canvas that refreshes periodically. It has no event stream and no scripting interface.

## Log inspection: `hu monitor log` vs. `ros2 topic echo /rosout`

The standard way to read ROS 2 logs from the CLI is `ros2 topic echo /rosout`, which has several friction points:

- It requires knowing the message type (`rcl_interfaces/msg/Log`) and outputs raw YAML, including binary stamp fields.
- There is no built-in level filter; filtering by severity requires a `grep` or `jq` pipe on the YAML output.
- There is no node filter; watching logs from a single node requires post-processing.
- The output is not structured — timestamps are split across `sec` and `nanosec` fields.

`hu monitor log` decodes `/rosout` at the CDR layer and presents a clean stream:

<!-- repro: skip needs /rosout traffic from an rclcpp node -->
```bash
# Tail all log messages
hu monitor log

# Stop after 50 messages
hu monitor log --count 50
```

`rqt_console` provides a GUI log viewer with level and node filters. `hu monitor log` covers basic log streaming from a terminal with optional count limiting.

---

## Log level control: `hu monitor log-level` vs. ros2cli vs. `rqt_logger_level`

| Operation | ros2cli | rqt | `hu` |
|---|---|---|---|
| Get all logger levels for a node | `ros2 node get-logger-levels /node` (Jazzy+) | rqt_logger_level | `hu monitor log-level <node>` |
| Set a logger level | `ros2 node set-logger-levels /node name level` (Jazzy+) | rqt_logger_level | `hu monitor log-level <node> <level>` |
| Works on Humble | no (`get/set-logger-levels` added in Jazzy) | yes | yes |

`hu monitor log-level` works on Humble nodes because it calls the `GetLoggerLevels` / `SetLoggerLevels` services directly via Zenoh, without relying on a ros2cli verb that was only added in Jazzy.

<!-- repro: skip needs an rclcpp node exposing logger services -->
```bash
# Set the planner's root logger to DEBUG
hu monitor log-level /planner DEBUG

# Read back all active loggers
hu monitor log-level /planner
```

---

## Plugin extensibility

| Step | ros2cli | rqt | hu |
|---|---|---|---|
| Register a new command | Add Python entry-point in `setup.cfg` | Write Qt plugin descriptor | Drop a `.wasm` file in `~/.local/share/hu/plugins/` |
| Install | `pip install` into the same Python env as ros2cli | Build and install Qt plugin package | Copy file — no registration step |
| Isolation | Shared Python runtime | Shared Qt runtime | Fully sandboxed per-plugin WASM instance |
| Zenoh session setup | N/A | N/A | Host opens sessions declared in plugin's manifest; plugin never handles connection setup |
| Works in hermetic / offline envs | no — requires pip | no — requires Qt | yes — single binary copy |

<!-- repro: run -->
```bash
# Drop a .wasm file and it becomes a plugin
# repro: skip my-debug-tool.wasm is a placeholder for a plugin the reader supplies
cp ./my-debug-tool.wasm ~/.local/share/hu/plugins/
hu plugin list           # shows all .wasm plugins found in search path
```

Plugins have access to the live ROS graph, raw CDR subscriptions, publishers, liveliness tokens, queryables, and named Zenoh sessions — all proxied through the host. A bridge plugin that needs two independent sessions (e.g. Humble and Jazzy) declares both in its manifest and the host opens them before the first event fires.

## When ros2cli is the right choice

`hu` requires a Zenoh router and is designed for hiroz and `rmw_zenoh_cpp` networks. It does not work with `rmw_fastrtps_cpp` or `rmw_cyclonedds_cpp` — if your nodes use a non-Zenoh RMW, `ros2 topic hz` will see messages that `hu meter hz` cannot.

Some `ros2cli` verbs have no `hu` equivalent and are not planned:

| ros2cli command | Status in `hu` |
|---|---|
| `ros2 launch` | not planned — launch is orthogonal to tooling |
| `ros2 pkg` | not planned — package management is a build-system concern |
| `ros2 interface show` | not planned — use `hu meter echo --raw` or the type description service |
| `ros2 doctor` | not planned — use `hu monitor graph` for connectivity diagnosis |
| `ros2 run` | not planned |

For existing rclcpp/rclpy codebases using DDS, ros2cli remains the right tool. For new Rust code on `rmw_zenoh_cpp` or pure hiroz networks, `hu` covers the common inspection workflows with better accuracy, no daemon, and machine-readable output.
